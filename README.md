I am a graphic designer and proactive worm catcher. Not your typical early bird; I have surpassing organization skills paired with an original creative flare for concept driven design. In high school, I would add design to every project assigned even when the project requirements didn’t include any design aspect. I get tickled with excitement when I am presented with a creative opportunity.
