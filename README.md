In high school it quickly became clear to me that I have a passion and love for art. There is an excitement that stirs within me whenever I am presented with a creative opportunity. I am student designer and proactive worm catcher. Not your typical early bird; I have surpassing organization skills paired with an original creative flare for concept driven design. A smiley solution to your problem.
