      <h3 class="push-1-4">Objective</h3>
      <p class="push milli" itemprop="description">The objective of this project was to build and design a brochure for a company following their brand.</p>

      <h2 class="push section-header">Process</h2>
      <div class="grid push">
        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-3 l-1-3 xl-1-3 pad-right">
          <h3 class="push-1-4">1. Research</h3>
          <p class="push-1-2 milli" itemprop="description">I began by researching Tim Hortons, their history and how their brand evolved over the years. They currently don’t have a brochure so I researched their cup and packaging designs and ads.</p>

        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-3 l-1-3 xl-1-3 pad-right">
          <h3 class="push-1-4">2. Gathering Assets</h3>
          <p class="push-1-2 milli" itemprop="description">Before I started to sketch I gathered high quality assets. This included images of their products, customer service shots, and their logo. I wanted to find simple images of their products without distracting backgrounds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-3 l-1-3 xl-1-3">
          <h3 class="push-1-4">3. Brand</h3>
          <p class="push-1-2 milli" itemprop="description">Tim Hortons colour palette is easily recognizable and very familiar to most Canadians. People can identify their coffee cup from a distance. Although their cup designs may vary from year to year, I picked a pattern that has been used multiple times that is still identified with Tim Hortons to this day.</p>
