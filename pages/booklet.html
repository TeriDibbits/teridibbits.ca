      <h3 class="push-1-4">Objective</h3>
      <p class="push milli" itemprop="description">The objective was to build and design a booklet that advertises the companies landscape supply products.</p>

      <h2 class="push section-header">Process</h2>
      <div class="grid push">

          <h3 class="push-1-4">1.Gathering Assets</h3>
          <p class="push-1-2 milli" itemprop="description">I began this project by gathering assets. I had access to file folders and USB’s to gather images. I gathered written content from their website as well as writing some content myself due to my knowledge of the work field and products.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-3 l-1-3 xl-1-3 pad-right">
          <h3 class="push-1-4">2.Research</h3>
          <p class="push-1-2 milli" itemprop="description">In order to get a scope on what to include about the products I conducted some preliminary research on the landscaping products and the companies that supplied them. I research booklet designs and layouts as well for inspiration before I began sketching.</p>

        <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-3 l-1-3 xl-1-3">
          <h3 class="push-1-4">3.Organization</h3>
          <p class="push-1-2 milli" itemprop="description">Before I could start sketching I had to organize the products into sections and decide what information was important to include. Decisions such as image content and placement had to be taken into consideration before sketching layouts.</p>

      <h3 class="push-1-4">5.Photography</h3>
      <p class="push-1-4 milli">The photography consists of suppliers’ product shots and the clients job photos. I had access to their landscape yard so I could photograph products that needed photos. Products that are sold by the yard, such as mulch and aggregates, needed a unique way to be displayed in the booklet that didn’t confine the product shot in a square. I took advantage of the opportunity to shoot my own photography and set up the products in small piles so the size and colour can be compared.</p>
