          <p class="push-1-2 milli" itemprop="description">I began this project by gathering assets. I had access to file folders and USB’s to gather images. I gathered written content from their website as well as writing some content myself due to my knowledge of the work field and products.</p>

          <p class="push-1-2 milli" itemprop="description">In order to get a scope on what to include about the products I conducted some preliminary research on the landscaping products and the companies that supplied them. I research booklet designs and layouts as well for inspiration before I began sketching.</p>
